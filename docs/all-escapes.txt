Sequence: ESC (^[)
Mnemonic: ESC
Description: Escape

ESCAPE is a control character used for code extension purposes. It
causes the meaning of a limited number of the bit combinations
following it in a CC-data-element to be changed. These bit
combinations, together with the preceding bit combination that
represents the ESC character, constitute an escape sequence.

Escape sequences provide the coded representations of
code-identification functions and of some types of control
functions. The various uses of escape sequences are specified in
clause 13. Code identification functions are specified in clauses 14
and 15.

Source: ECMA-35 6th Ed. 6.2.2

An escape sequence shall consist of two or more bytes. In an 8-bit
code a byte shall be an 8-bit combination. In a 7-bit code a byte
shall be a 7-bit combination.

The first byte of an escape sequence shall be the bit combination
representing the ESCAPE character and the last shall be known as the
Final Byte. An escape sequence may also contain one or more bytes
known as Intermediate bytes.

The function represented by an escape sequence shall be determined by
its Intermediate byte(s), if any, and by its Final Byte.

Intermediate bytes shall be any of the 16 positions of column 02 of
the code table; they are denoted by the symbol I.

Final bytes shall be any of the 79 positions of columns 03 to 07 of
the code table excluding position 07/15; they are denoted by the
symbol F.

NOTE 40
Although, in this Standard, escape sequences are specified in terms of
bytes or positions in the code table, the meaning of an escape
sequence is determined only by its bit combinations and it is
unaffected by any meaning assigned to those bit combinations taken
individually.

Bit combinations in columns 00 and 01 and the bit combination 07/15
shall not be used as either Intermediate or Final bytes to construct
an escape sequence. In an 8-bit code bit combinations in columns 08 to
15 also shall not be so used.

NOTE 41
As these prohibited bytes may appear in an escape sequence in error,
it may be necessary within an application to provide methods of
identifying such a situation and of recovering from it, but this is
not covered by this Standard.

Description: Designate other coding system

15.4.1 Purpose

A code-identification function is provided to designate and invoke an
identified coding system different from that of this Standard, not
necessarily a character code. It provides a means for switching
between coding systems according to this Standard and other coding
systems when it is not performed at an outer level (e.g. 15.3).

Each such other coding system is registered in the ISO International
Register of Coded Character Sets (see annex B), together with a Final
Byte (and where necessary one or more associated Intermediate bytes)
to identify it.

This function is also recommended for use by such other coding systems
for returning to the coding system of this Standard, by the use of a
reserved Final Byte which identifies it.

NOTE 56
Other standards specify alternative methods for achieving an effect
similar to that of DOCS, e.g. those based on the upper layers defined
in ISO 7498 - Open Systems Interconnection, Basic Reference Model.

15.4.2 Specification

Name: DESIGNATE OTHER CODING SYSTEM Acronym: DOCS
Coded representation: ESC 02/05 F or ESC 02/05 I F

DOCS shall designate and invoke an identified coding system. In the
coded representation of DOCS the F byte (and any associated I bytes)
shall identify the coding system.

DOCS with Final Byte 04/00, without I byte, shall designate the coding
system of this Standard. It is intended for use by other coding
systems for returning to this coding system. It shall restore the
state of the coding system to that at the time of invocation of the
other coding system, that is the state established by announcer
functions, and the designation and invocation state of graphic
character and control character sets. Whether or not other states,
e.g. the active position, are restored is outside the scope of this
Standard.

DOCS with I byte 02/15 shall mean that the other coding system does
not use DOCS (F = 04/00), coded as specified here, to return (it may
have an alternate means to return or none at all). It shall also mean
that after such a return (if any) the previous state of this coding
system (i.e. announcements, designations, and invocations) is
undefined.

DOCS with any other I byte, or with no I byte, shall mean that the
other coding system uses DOCS (F = 04/00) to return.

Sequence: ESC % / 0 length charset STX
Description: switch to named variable-length encoding

This is part of the X11 COMPOUND_TEXT format, and is used to escape
to a character encoding not directly supported by that standard.
This version is for encodings with a variable number of octets per
character.

"length" consists of two octets, M and L, that between them define
the number of octets of data that follow to be ((M-128)*128) + (L-128).
The top bits of M and L are always set.  "charset" is a
character set name from the X Consortium CharSet registry.  STX is
followed by octets encoded in that character set.  "length" includes
the length of the charset name and the STX.

Sequence: DCS P1 ; P2 ; P3 q Ps ST
Description: Sixel graphics

          P1  is  the  macro  parameter. This parameter indicates the pixel
          aspect ratio used by the  application  or  terminal.    The pixel
          aspect ratio  defines the  shape of  the pixel  dots the terminal
          uses to draw images.  For example, a pixel that is twice  as high
          as it is wide has an aspect ratio of 2:1.

          NOTE:  The  macro  parameter  is  provided for compatibility with
          existing Digital software.  New applications  should set  P1 to 0
          and  use  the  set  raster attributes control, described later in
          this chapter.

               P1          Pixel Aspect Ratio
                           (Vertical:Horizontal)

               7,8, or 9   1:1

          P2 selects how the terminal draws the background color.   You can 3$
          use one of three values.

               P2          Meaning

               0 or 2      Pixel positions  specified as  0 are  set to the
                           current background color.

               1           Pixel positions specified as  0 remain  at their
                           current color.

          P3 is  the horizontal  grid size  parameter.  The horizontal grid
          size is the horizontal distance  between  two  pixel  dots.   The
          VT300 ignores  this parameter because the horizontal grid size is
          fixed at 0.0195 cm (0.0075 in).

In the data section:

Characters from ? to ~ encode a column of pixels one wide and six
high.  ? is all-zeros, ~ is all-ones and the low-order bit is at the
top.

! Pn encodes a repeat count of the following character
- causes the next band of sixels to start below the current one at the left
  margin
$ causes the next band to overlay the current one, starting at the left margin.
# Pn selects palette entry Pn.
# Pn1 ; Pn2 ; Pn3 ; Pn4 ; Pn5 sets palette entry Pn1 to contain the colour
  (Pn3, Pn4, Pn5) in the colour space represented by Pn1 (1 = HLS, 2 = RGB).
Anything else is ignored.

Mnemonic: DECDLD
Description: Down-line load DRCS characters

Pfn;Pcn;Pe;Pcms;Pw;Pt are parameter characters, separated by
semicolons, that define parameters described in Table 4-9. Valid
values for Pcms, Pw, and Pt are: Pcms = 0, 2, 3 or 4; Pw = 0, 1 or 2;
and Pt = 0 or 1. Invalid combinations are ignored. A font loaded for
80 columns can be used in 132 columns and a font loaded for 132
columns can be used in 80 columns.

{ (7/11) is the final character that signals the end of the parameter
characters and specifies a DECDLD function.

Dscs defines the character set "name" for the soft font, and is used
in the SCS (select character set) escape sequence.

Sxbp1;Sxbp2;...;Sxbpn are sixel bit patterns (1 to 94 patterns) for
characters separated by semicolons.  Each sixel bit pattern has the
form:

    S...S/S...S

where the first S...S represents the upper columns (sixels) of the
DRCS character, the slash (2/5) advances the sixel pattern to the
lower columns of the DRCS character, and the second S...S represents
the lower columns (sixels) of the DRCS (see Figure 4-6).

ST (9/12) is the string terminator. It is an 8-bit control character
that you can also express as ESC \ (1/11 5/12) when coding for a 7-bit
environment.

Mnemonic: DECDMAC

You can define macros that are interpreted as normal input when
emulating the VT420 terminal.  Any macro definitions that do not fit
into the memory allotted are ignored. An RIS or DECSR clears all macro
definitions. A soft reset (DECSTR) has no effect.

Pn1: Macro ID number (0-63). If you give a macro an ID number that
already exists, the old macro definition is deleted and the new one is
used. If <n1> exceeds 63, Reflection ignores this control
function. Everything but the Csi 5i and Csi 4i control functions are
passed to the printer.

Pn2: Determine how a new macro definition is treated: If Pn2 is 0 or
omitted, an old macro with the same macro ID number is deleted. If
Pn2 is 1, DECDMAC deletes all current macro definitions before
defining this macro. If <n2> is a number that is not 0 or 1, the macro
is ignored.

Pn3: Select the encoding format for the text of the macro definition:
If Pn3 is 0 or omitted, ASCII text is used in the macro. If Pn3 is
1, hex pairs are used (each pair of characters in the macro is the hex
value for a single ASCII character. If Pn3 is a number that is not 0
or 1, the macro is ignored. The string of text and control functions
to be performed when the macro is invoked. If hex pairs are used, you
can also use a repeat introducer (!) in Ps. The repeat introducer
lets you repeat any hex pair in the definition string any number of
times.

Description: Insert character

Parameter default value: Pn = 1

If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to PRESENTATION, ICH
is used to prepare the insertion of n characters, by putting into the
erased state the active presentation position and, depending on the
setting of the CHARACTER EDITING MODE (HEM), the n-1 preceding or
following character positions in the presentation component, where n
equals the value of Pn. The previous contents of the active
presentation position and an adjacent string of character positions
are shifted away from the active presentation position. The contents
of n character positions at the other end of the shifted part are
removed. The active presentation position is moved to the line home
position in the active line. The line home position is established by
the parameter value of SET LINE HOME (SLH).

The extent of the shifted part is established by SELECT EDITING EXTENT
(SEE).

The effect of ICH on the start or end of a selected area, the start or
end of a qualified area, or a tabulation stop in the shifted part, is
not defined by this Standard.

If the DEVICE COMPONENT SELECT MODE (DCSM) is set to DATA, ICH is used
to prepare the insertion of n characters, by putting into the erased
state the active data position and, depending on the setting of the
CHARACTER EDITING MODE (HEM), the n-1 preceding or following character
positions in the data component, where n equals the value of Pn. The
previous contents of the active data position and an adjacent string
of character positions are shifted away from the active data
position. The contents of n character positions at the other end of
the shifted part are removed. The active data position is moved to the

Sequence: CSI Ps [
Mnemonic: SRS
Description: Start reversed string

Parameter default value: Ps = 0

SRS is used to establish in the data component the beginning and the
end of a string of characters as well as the direction of the
string. This direction is opposite to that currently established. The
indicated string follows the preceding text. The established character
progression is not affected.

The beginning of a reversed string is indicated by SRS with a
parameter value of 1. A reversed string may contain one or more nested
strings. These nested strings may be reversed strings the beginnings
of which are indicated by SRS with a parameter value of 1, or directed
strings the beginnings of which are indicated by START DIRECTED STRING
(SDS) with a parameter value not equal to 0. Every beginning of such a
string invokes the next deeper level of nesting.

This Standard does not define the location of the active data position
within any such nested string.

The end of a reversed string is indicated by SRS with a parameter
value of 0. Every end of such a string re-establishes the next higher
level of nesting (the one in effect prior to the string just
ended). The direction is re-established to that in effect prior to the
string just ended. The active data position is moved to the character
position following the characters of the string just ended.

The parameter values are:

0 end of a reversed string; re-establish the previous direction
1 beginning of a reversed string; reverse the direction.

NOTE 1
The effect of receiving a CVT, HT, SCP, SPD or VT control function
within an SRS string is not defined by this Standard.

NOTE 2
The control functions for area definition (DAQ, EPA, ESA, SPA, SSA)
should not be used within an SRS string.

Mnemonic: PTX
Description: Parallel texts

Parameter default value: Ps = 0

PTX is used to delimit strings of graphic characters that are
communicated one after another in the data stream but that are
intended to be presented in parallel with one another, usually in
adjacent lines.

The parameter values are

0 end of parallel texts
1 beginning of a string of principal parallel text
2 beginning of a string of supplementary parallel text
3 beginning of a string of supplementary Japanese phonetic annotation
4 beginning of a string of supplementary Chinese phonetic annotation
5 end of a string of supplementary phonetic annotations

PTX with a parameter value of 1 indicates the beginning of the string
of principal text intended to be presented in parallel with one or
more strings of supplementary text.  PTX with a parameter value of 2,
3 or 4 indicates the beginning of a string of supplementary text that
is intended to be presented in parallel with either a string of
principal text or the immediately preceding string of supplementary
text, if any; at the same time it indicates the end of the preceding
string of principal text or of the immediately preceding string of
supplementary text, if any. The end of a string of supplementary text
is indicated by a subsequent occurrence of PTX with a parameter value
other than 1.

PTX with a parameter value of 0 indicates the end of the strings of
text intended to be presented in parallel with one another.

NOTE

PTX does not explicitly specify the relative placement of the strings
of principal and supplementary parallel texts, or the relative sizes
of graphic characters in the strings of parallel text. A string of
supplementary text is normally presented in a line adjacent to the
line containing the string of principal text, or adjacent to the line
containing the immediately preceding string of supplementary text, if
any. The first graphic character of the string of principal text and
the first graphic character of a string of supplementary text are
normally presented in the same position of their respective lines.
However, a string of supplementary text longer (when presented) than
the associated string of principal text may be centred on that
string. In the case of long strings of text, such as paragraphs in
different languages, the strings may be presented in successive lines
in parallel columns, with their beginnings aligned with one another
and the shorter of the paragraphs followed by an appropriate amount of
"white space".

Japanese phonetic annotation typically consists of a few half-size or
smaller Kana characters which indicate the pronunciation or
interpretation of one or more Kanji characters and are presented above
those Kanji characters if the character path is horizontal, or to the
right of them if the character path is vertical.

Chinese phonetic annotation typically consists of a few Pinyin
characters which indicate the pronunciation of one or more Hanzi
characters and are presented above those Hanzi characters.
Alternatively, the Pinyin characters may be presented in the same line
as the Hanzi characters and following the respective Hanzi
characters. The Pinyin characters will then be presented within
enclosing pairs of parentheses.

Mnemonic: SDS
Description: Start directed string

Parameter default value: Ps = 0

SDS is used to establish in the data component the beginning and the
end of a string of characters as well as the direction of the
string. This direction may be different from that currently
established. The indicated string follows the preceding text. The
established character progression is not affected.

The beginning of a directed string is indicated by SDS with a
parameter value not equal to 0. A directed string may contain one or
more nested strings. These nested strings may be directed strings the
beginnings of which are indicated by SDS with a parameter value not
equal to 0, or reversed strings the beginnings of which are indicated
by START REVERSED STRING (SRS) with a parameter value of 1.  Every
beginning of such a string invokes the next deeper level of nesting.

This Standard does not define the location of the active data position
within any such nested string.

The end of a directed string is indicated by SDS with a parameter
value of 0. Every end of such a string re-establishes the next higher
level of nesting (the one in effect prior to the string just
ended). The direction is re-established to that in effect prior to the
string just ended. The active data position is moved to the character
position following the characters of the string just ended.

The parameter values are:
0 end of a directed string; re-establish the previous direction
1 start of a directed string; establish the direction left-to-right
2 start of a directed string; establish the direction right-to-left

NOTE 1
The effect of receiving a CVT, HT, SCP, SPD or VT control function
within an SDS string is not defined by this Standard.

NOTE 2
The control functions for area definition (DAQ, EPA, ESA, SPA, SSA)
should not be used within an SDS string.

Locator Controller Mode allows the host to communicate directly with
the locator device without terminal intervention (similar to printer
controller mode). When locator controller mode is set, all data
received at the host port is transferred directly to the locator port
without interpretation by the display terminal. The only exceptions
are the communications control characters XON/XOFF (if enabled), and
the control sequence to disabled locator controller mode. All
characters received at locator port are transferred to the host port
without interpretation. The host assumes full responsibility for the
locator device.

Locator controller mode is desirable for two reasons: 

1. It allows the host to explicitly initialize or configure locator
   devices. A foriegn locator device might not wake up in DEC format
   for example.

2. It allows the locator port to be used for other auxilliary input
   devices. A bar code reader could be interfaced to the locator port
   for example, allowing the terminal to support a bar code reader
   without pre-empting the printer port.

subsequent text. The established aspects remain in effect until the
next occurrence of SGR in the data stream, depending on the setting of
the GRAPHIC RENDITION COMBINATION MODE (GRCM). Each graphic rendition
aspect is specified by a parameter value:

  Items with no marking are ECMA-48 standard ones. ]

    blink, or as bold background.  For example, the

Description: Set specific margin

 This sequence can be used to set any one of the 4 margins. Parameter
 Ps indicates which margin to set (Ps=0 for the top margin, Ps=1 for
 the bottom, Ps=2 for the left and Ps=3 for the right). Pn is the row
 or column to set the margin to. If after this control sequence has
 been processed, the top or bottom margins are not at the top of the
 screen, and the left and right margins are at the screen boundary,
 then the scrolling region is set to the size specified.  If either of
 the left or right margins are not at the screen boundary then the
 scrolling region is bound by the current margins.

Sequence: CSI Ps ... o
Mnemonic: DAQ
Description: Define area qualification

Parameter default value: Ps = 0

DAQ is used to indicate that the active presentation position in the
presentation component is the first character position of a qualified
area. The last character position of the qualified area is the
character position in the presentation component immediately preceding
the first character position of the following qualified area.

The parameter value designates the type of qualified area:
0 unprotected and unguarded
1 protected and guarded
2 graphic character input
3 numeric input
4 alphabetic input
5 input aligned on the last character position of the qualified area
6 fill with ZEROs
7 set a character tabulation stop at the active presentation position
  (the first character position of the qualified area) to indicate the
  beginning of a field
8 protected and unguarded
9 fill with SPACEs
10 input aligned on the first character position of the qualified area
11 the order of the character positions in the input field is
   reversed, i.e. the last position in each line becomes the first and
   vice versa; input begins at the new first position.

This control function operates independently of the setting of the
TABULATION STOP MODE (TSM).  The character tabulation stop set by
parameter value 7 applies to the active line only.

NOTE
The control functions for area definition (DAQ, EPA, ESA, SPA, SSA)
should not be used within an SRS string or an SDS string.

Sequence: CSI Pn1 ; Pn2 ; Pn3 ; Pn4 r
Mnemonic: CSR
Description: Change Scrolling Region

Where 3 or more parameters are specified, the parameters are the top,
bottom, left and right margins respectively. If you omit the last
parameter, the extreme edge of the screen is assumed to be the right
margin.

If any of the parameters are out of bounds, they are clipped. If any
of the parameters would cause an overlap (i.e. the bottom margin is
higher than the top margin, or the right margin is less that the left
margin), then this command is ignored and no scrolling region or
window will be active. If all of the parameters are correct, then the
cursor is moved to the top left hand corner of the newly-created
region. The new region will now define the bounds of all scroll and
cursor motion operations. 

[ If only two parameters are specified, this behaves as DECSTBM ]

Description: Set scrolling

If Pn > 0, sets the screen to scroll Pn lines whenever a LF would push
the cursor off the bottom.  Setting it to the number of lines on the
screen causes the screen to clear when it fills.

If Pn == 0, sets "wrap mode", where the cursor moves back to the top
line of the screen when LFed off the bottom, and where lines are
cleared when the cursor LFs into them.

The ESC[! is the code that RIP supporting BBS's use to determine
whether your terminal has RIP (Remote Imaging Protocol) support.  If so,
then your terminal returns a string to the remote side in the form
"RIPScript version x.xx" or some such thing.  This is probably why you have
been receiving that code.

Sequence: CSI Pe ; Pb ; Pr ; Pc ; Pp & w
Mnemonic: DECLRP
Description: Locator report

When a selected trigger event occurs such as a button press or
release, the terminal transmits a locator position report as follows.

Pe is the event code 
Pb is the button code 
Pr is the row coordinate 
Pc is the column coordinate 
Pp is the third coordinate (page number) 

Pe, the event code indicates what event caused this report to be
generated. The following event codes are defined:

0 - request, the terminal received an explicit request 
    for a locator report, but the locator is unavailable 
1 - request, the terminal received an explicit 
    request for a locator report 
2 - left button down 
3 - left button up 
4 - middle button down 
5 - middle button up 
6 - right button down 
7 - right button up 
8 - fourth button down 
9 - fourth button up 
10 - locator outside filter rectangle 

Pb is the button code, ASCII decimal 0-15 indicating which buttons are
down if any. The state of the four buttons on the locator correspond
to the low four bits of the decimal value, "1" means button depressed

0 - no buttons down 
1 - right 
2 - middle 
4 - left 
8 - fourth 

Pr is the row coordinate of the locator position in the page, encoded
as an ASCII decimal value. If Pr is omitted, the locator position is
undefined (outside the terminal window for example).

Pc is the column coordinate of the locator position in the page,
encoded as an ASCII decimal value.  If Pc is omitted, the locator
position is undefined (outside the terminal window for example).

Pp is the page coordinate of the locator position encoded as an ASCII
decimal value. The page coordinate may be omitted if the locator is on
page one (the default).

Each locator report includes both the specific transition which caused
this event, and the current button state. This allows software to
determine what event just occured and which buttons are down without
keeping track of previous events or button state. In a multiprocess
shared locator environment, an application may not know the previous
button state. This dual reporting also allows applications to recover
from lost locator reports.

Each locator event generates a single report. In the rare situation
where two events occur simultaneously (within a single sampling
period), the terminal will report this as two separate events. The
order of reporting shall be by increasing event code number (left
button first).

Locator events are queued in the keyboard input silo just like
keystrokes. Each locator event occupies one position in the silo (the
keyboard silo currently must have at least 9 positions). If the input
silo becomes full, the locator and keyboard are locked until there is
again room in the silo. The sequential order of keystroke and locator
events is strictly maintained.

It is the responsibility of the host to accept data fast enough to
avoid locking the locator unintentionally. The limited buffering
inside the terminal gives the host a little more time to process
locator events smoothly.

When the keyboard is locked, the "wait" indicator on the keyboard
turns on. The keyboard is automatically locked any time the keyboard
input silo is full. The keyboard can be locked explicitly using the
keyboard action mode (KAM) control function.

When the locator is locked, the terminal continues to track the
locator, but the input cursor changes shape to appear as a wristwatch
(or other shape indicating to wait). The wristwatch cursor indicates
that locator button transitions will be ignored, but allows the user
to continue positioning in anticipation of the locator being
unlocked. The locator is automatically locked any time the input silo
is full.

Locator-ahead, analogous to keyboard type-ahead is supported by having
each report include the locator position at the time of the event, and
maintaining the sequential order of keystroke and locator events.

A final implication of using the keyboard silo to buffer text locator
events is that locator and keyboard input should be associated with
the same session at all times. The session to receive these events is
sometimes called the "active session" or "input focus". In a
multi-session windowing environment, the input cursor is allowed to
roam freely over the entire screen in response to locator
movement. The input cursor is never occluded when locator reporting is
enabled in one or more sessions. Each session enables locator
reporting independently. The following cases describe the locator
interaction with session viewports and scroll regions.

1. The input cursor is within the active session's viewport. Pressing
   a button on the locator sends alocator report when enabled. 

2. The input cursor is inside the active session's viewport, but
   outside the range of defined coordinates for that session. Pressing
   a button on the locator will generate a report with omitted
   coordinates (position undefined). An example would be when the
   input cursor is outside the active scrolling region, and the origin
   mode has been set to relative. To use the locator to adjust scroll
   margins, the origin mode must be absolute.

3. The input cursor is not contained in any viewport. Pressing a
   button on the locator will have no effect. To support "pop up"
   menus anywhere on the screen, the entire screen must be a viewport
   for at least one session.

4. The input cursor is within a viewport of a session which is not the
   active session. Pressing a button on the locator will normally make
   the session containing the input cursor the active session
   (possibly changing the occlusion order of viewports, and the shape
   of the locator). This case is the responsibility of the "window
   manager" which is free to define its own user interface. Two
   recommendations are: (1) No locator report should be sent to the
   previous active session, since the locator is not in its viewport;
   and (2) If locator reporting is enabled in the new session, a
   locator report should not be transmitted to avoid application side
   affects when selecting another window.

Description: Enable filter rectangle

Filter Rectangles add filtered movement events to the list of locator
transitions that can generate reports.

Pt - Top boundary of filter rectangle 
Pl - Left boundary of filter rectangle 
Pb - Bottom boundary of filter rectangle 
Pr - Right boundary of filter rectangle 

The DECEFR control sequence defines the coordinates of a filter
rectangle, and activates it.  Anytime the locator is detected to be
outside a filter rectangle, an outside rectangle event is generated
and the rectangle is disabled. Filter rectangles are always treated as
"one-shot" events. Defining a new rectangle re-activates it.

Applications can re-define the rectangle at any time even if its
already active. If a rectangle which does not contain the locator is
specified, the terminal will generate an outside rectangle report
immediately and deactivate it.

Pt, Pl, Pb, and Pr are in coordinates units specified by the last
DECELR sequence. The filter rectangle includes the boundaries (similar
to other rectangular area operations). The origin is coordinate pair
1:1 in the upper left corner. If any parameters are omitted, they are
defaulted to the current locator position. Sending DECEFR with no
parameters will cause the application to be notified for any locator
movement ("unfiltered movement event").

DECELR always cancels any previous filter rectangle definition. This
gaurantees that when an application enables locator reports, there
will never be an outstanding filter rectangle.

If a filter rectangle lies on the edge of the defined coordinate space
for the active session, and the locator crosses that edge, the
rectangle may be triggered to send a report with omitted coordinates
(locator position undefined).

If the active session receives a filter rectangle with explicit
coordinates while the locator is outside the defined coordinate space,
the rectangle will be triggered to send a report with omitted
coordinates.

If the active session receives a filter rectangle with omitted
coordinates (that is, use the current position) while the locator is
outside the defined coordinate space (position undefined), the
rectangle will be triggered the next time the locator is within the
defined coordinate space.

If a session which is not the active session receives a filter
rectangle with explicit coordinates, it should trigger immediately
with position undefined. If a session which is not the active session
receives a rectangle with omitted coordinates, it should trigger the
next time the locator is within the defined coordinate space for that
session, which cannot happen until the session becomes active.

Sequence: CSI Ps ; Pu ' z
Mnemonic: DECELR
Description: Enable locator reports

Locator reporting can be selectively enabled from the host using a DEC
private control sequence.  When disabled (the power up default), the
locator cursor does not appear, and the locator buttons are
inactive. When enabled, the locator cursor is visible, and the
terminal tracks the locator locally with no host
intervention. Individual locator events such as locator button
transitions or movement may be programmed to send locator reports to
the host.

Ps may assume the following values 

0 locator disabled (default) 

1 locator reports enabled 

2 one shot (allow one report, then disable) 

Pu specifies the coordinate units for locator reports 

0 (or omitted) default to character cells 

1 device physical pixels 

2 character cells 

One shot mode is provided for applications that desire simple graphics
input similar to Tektronix GIN mode (no unsolicited reports). If
parameter value 2 is selected, the next trigger event that occurs will
generate a single locator report. No further locator reports will
occur (the locator will be disabled), until another DECELR sequence is
received.

The coordinate units for locator position reports may be selected to
either of two coordinate systems used by terminal software at the
lowest level. Physical pixels is the "least common denominator", and
is useful for computing sixel positions.

Sequence: CSI Ps ' |
Mnemonic: DECRQLP
Description: Request locator position

The host may explicitly request a locator position report any time
locator reporting is enabled (DECELR). Upon receiving such a request,
the terminal will immediately send a single locator report (DECLRP)
with event code 1 indicating the current locator position.

If the session receiving the request is the active session, but the
locator is not within the defined coordinate range for that session,
the terminal will respond with omitted coordinates (locator position
undefined).

If the session receiving the request is not currently active (the
locator is being used in another session), the report will specify
event code 0 (locator unavailable). Locator state from the active
session should not be made available to inactive sessions.

If the locator is disabled (DECELR), the terminal should still respond
with event code 0 (to avoid timing out the application).

Ps: 
0 (or omitted) default to 1 
1 transmit a single DECLRP locator report all others ignored

Description: Select attribute change extent

Select which character positions within a rectangular area can have
their attributes changed or reversed. The DECSACE control function
affects the rectangular area control functions for changing and
reversing attributes (DECCARA and DECRARA).

The Ps parameter specifies what character positions are affected. 0 or
1 indicates a stream of character positions that begins in the first
position specified in the DECCARA or DECRARA control function, and
ends with the second one that is specified. A 2 indicates a
rectangular area of character positions; the DECCARA and DECRARA
control functions specify the upper left and lower right corners of
the area.

Sequence: CSI Pn1 ; Pn2 ; Pn3 ; Pn4 ; Pn5 ; Pn6 * y
Mnemonic: DECRQCRA
Description: Request checksum of rectangular area

Request a memory checksum of a rectangular area on a specified
page. The terminal returns a checksum report (DECCKSR) in
response. DECRQCRA also works on the status line.

Parameters:

Pn1 A numeric label you give to identify the checksum request
(DECCKSR returns this number).

Pn2 The number of the page on which the rectangular area is
located. If Pn2 is 0 or omitted, the terminal ignores the remaining
parameters and reports a checksum for all pages in page memory. If
<n2> is more than the number of pages, Reflection does a checksum on
the last page.

Pn3 to Pn6 define the area to be checksummed:

Pn3 Top row
Pn4 Right column
Pn5 Bottom row
Pn6 Left column

If Pn3 .. Pn6 are omitted, the entire page is checksummed.  The
co-ordinates are affected by DECOM.

Description: Zero default mode

ZERO (reset):
A parameter value of 0 of a control function means the number 0.

DEFAULT (set):
A parameter value of 0 represents a default parameter value which may
be different from 0.

NOTE 1
This mode was provided for implementations of the first edition of
this Standard which specified that "an empty parameter sub-string or a
parameter sub-string which consists of bit combinations 03/00 only
represents a default value which depends on the control function".

For numeric parameters which are expressed in units established by the
parameter value of SELECT SIZE UNIT (SSU) the value 0 could then be
specified. For numeric parameters which are effectively repeat counts,
a 0 parameter value corresponded to a "no-op". In either instance,
non-negative computed numeric parameter values might have been used
without treating 0 as a special (unusable) case.

Where an explicit parameter value was not used, implementors were
urged to omit a parameter value (use an empty parameter sub-string) to
imply a default parameter value.

Control functions affected are: CBT, CHA, CHT, CNL, CPL, CPR, CUB,
CUD, CUF, CUP, CUU, CVT, DCH, DL, ECH, GSM, HPA, HPB, HPR, HVP, ICH,

NOTE 2
Since the publication of the first edition of this Standard in 1976
almost 15 years have expired. The use of this mode should no longer be
required because the definition of default parameter values has been
changed.

Description: Lock display

Lock display. When set, this mode causes xwsh to keep its display set
to the current location in the retain buffer. Any scrolling
activities, line insert/deletes will not affect the retain buffer that
is outside of the display. When reset, scrolling off the bottom will
move the display to track the bottom of the retain buffer. When the
lock is set, the scroll bar is disabled, as well as any extend
selection mechanisms that might cause a scroll. The normal mode is in
the reset state, but the standard terminfo for iris-ansi causes visual
programs to lock the display.

        (DECPAM) and the ANSI/VT52 mode (DECANM) is set.  Under these
        conditions, if this mode is reset, the cursor keys will send ANSI
        cursor control commands.  If setm the cursor keys will send application
        function commands.

        causes a 132 column screen to be used.

Source: <URL: http://www.cs.utk.edu/~shuford/terminal/vt100_codes_news.txt>

NOTE: When the terminal receives the sequence, the screen is erased
and the cursor moves to the home position. This also sets the scrolling
region for full screen (24 lines).

Source: <http://vt100.net/docs/vt220-rm/chapter4.html#S4.6.10>

If you change the DECCOLM setting, the terminal:
 + Sets the left, right, top and bottom scrolling margins to their default
   positions.
 + Erases all data in page memory, unless DECNCSM is set; then, the page
   is not erased.

DECCOLM resets vertical split screen mode (DECLRMM) to unavailable.

DECCOLM clears data from the status line if the status line is set to
host-writable.

Description: Origin mode

        This is a private parameter to SM and RM control sequences.  The reset
        state causes the origin (or home position) to be the upper left
        character position of the screen.  Line and column numbers are,
        therefore, independent of current margin settings.  The cursor may be
        positioned outside the margins with a cursor position (CUP) or
        horizontal and vertical position (HVP) control.

        The set state causes the origin to be at the upper left character
        position within the current margins.  Line and column numbers are,
        therefore, relative to the current margin settings.  The cursor cannot
        be positioned outside of the margins.

        The cursor is moved to the new home position when this mode is set or
        reset.  Lines and columns are numbered consecutively, with the origin
        being line 1, column 1.

	The scroll margins are set using the DECSTBM control sequence.

Parameters (such as pointer position and button number) for all mouse
tracking escape sequences generated by xterm encode numeric parameters
in a single character as value+32.  For example, !  specifies the value
1.  The upper left character position on the terminal is denoted as 1,1.

X10 compatibility mode sends an escape sequence only on button press,
encoding the location and the mouse button pressed.  It is enabled by
specifying parameter 9 to DECSET.  On button press, xterm sends CSI M
CbCxCy (6 characters).  Cb is button-1.  Cx and Cy are the x and y coor-
dinates of the mouse when the button was pressed.

Description: X11 normal mouse tracking

Parameters (such as pointer position and button number) for all mouse
tracking escape sequences generated by xterm encode numeric parameters
in a single character as value+32.  For example, !  specifies the value
1.  The upper left character position on the terminal is denoted as 1,1.

Normal tracking mode sends an escape sequence on both button press and
release.  Modifier key (shift, ctrl, meta) information is also sent.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1000 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, xterm sends CSI M CbCxCy.  The low two bits of Cb encode button
information: 0=MB1 pressed, 1=MB2 pressed, 2=MB3 pressed, 3=release.
The upper bits encode the modifiers which were down when the button was
pressed and are added together.  4=Shift, 8=Meta, 16=Control.  Cx and Cy
are the x and y coordinates of the mouse event.  The upper left corner
is (1,1).

the release coordinates.  It is enabled by specifying parameter 1001 to
DECSET.  Highlighting is performed only for button 1, though other but-
ton events can be received.  Warning: use of this mode requires a coop-
erating program or it will hang xterm.  On button press, the same infor-
mation as for normal tracking is generated; xterm then waits for the
program to send mouse tracking information.  All X events are ignored
until the proper escape sequence is received from the pty: CSI Ps ; Ps ;
Ps ; Ps ; Ps T .  The parameters are func, startx, starty, firstrow, and
lastrow.  func is non-zero to initiate hilite tracking and zero to
abort.  startx and starty give the starting x and y location for the
highlighted region.  The ending location tracks the mouse, but will
never be above row firstrow and will always be above row lastrow.  (The
top of the screen is row 1.)  When the button is released, xterm reports
the ending position one of two ways: if the start and end coordinates
are valid text locations: CSI t CxCy.  If either coordinate is past the
end of the line: CSI T CxCyCxCyCxCy.  The parameters are startx, starty,
endx, endy, mousex, and mousey.  startx, starty, endx, and endy give the
starting and ending character positions of the region.  mousex and
mousey give the location of the mouse at button up, which may not be
over a character.

Mode: ?1002
Description: X11 button-event mouse tracking

Button-event tracking is essentially the same as normal tracking, but
xterm also reports button-motion events.  Motion events are reported
only if the mouse pointer has moved to a different character cell.  It
is enabled by specifying parameter 1002 to DECSET.  On button press or
release, xterm sends the same codes used by normal tracking mode.  On
button-motion events, xterm adds 4 to the event code (the third charac-
ter, Cb).  The low two bits of the event code encode the button informa-
tion.  The third bit is set to indicate motion.  Additional bits specify
modifier keys as in normal mode.  For example, motion into cell x,y with
button 1 down is reported as CSI M @ CxCy.  ( @  = 32 + 0 (button 1) +
32 (motion indicator) ).  Similarly, motion with button 3 down is
reported as CSI M B CxCy.  ( B  = 32 + 2 (button 3) + 32 (motion indica-
tor) ).

Mode: ?1003
Description: X11 any-event mouse tracking

Any-event mode is the same as button-event mode, except that all motion
events are reported instead of just those that enter a new character
cell.  It is enabled by specifying 1003 to DECSET.
