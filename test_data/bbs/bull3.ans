[1;40;34m Let's face it.  If I force you to upload, you'll upload junk.  Not only to slippast the ratios, but just to spite me for being so cruel.  Plus, [1;40;36mratios are
stuffy[1;40;34m, so there aren't any on this board.  But if you have a file you think is
neat, upload it anyway.  Why?  Becaause other people have given you [1;40;36m1402
[1;40;34mneat files for you to download and the least you can do is give something back.
If you can't find anything worth uploading or you don't want to upload, don't
upload. Nobody'll get mad at you.  [1;40;36mNobody'll even notice.  [1;40;34mIf you do upload,
you're not going to be swamped by people saying [1;40;36m"Thanks for that file you
uploaded."  [1;40;34mYou do however get a [1;40;36mhefty time bonus [1;40;34mwhich you can put in the time
bank and save for later, and come Judgement Day you will have one thing going
for you.
[1;40;36m                   "Well, I uploaded to Da Warren once..."
[1;40;34m Just don't upload any illegal stuff or it won't count. [1;40;36mThink you can handle
that?
