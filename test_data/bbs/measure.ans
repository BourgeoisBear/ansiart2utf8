[0;40;37m[1;40;37m [1;40;32mDa Warren callers! A desperate time is upon us! Out stuffy enemies have struck
[1;40;37ma deadly blow to our movement by using stuffy words for our units of
[1;40;34mmeasyurement!  Look at ome of the words we use every day - meter, picosecond,

[0;40;31mOpposed To Tyrannical Units of Measurement In The Sciences And Elsewhere
[1;40;33m(DWACOTTOMITSAE) [1;40;37mhas proposed that our units of measurement be renamed.  Here
[1;40;35mare some examples:

[1;40;37mmole [1;40;32m-> llama, as in, "6 llamas of sodium metal"
[1;40;37mlight-year [1;40;36m-> Consumers Digest Best Buy, as in, "The nearest star is 4.3
[1;40;37m              [1;40;36mConsumers Digest Best Buys away from our sun."
[1;40;37mtorr [1;40;30m-> do not change
[1;40;37mpica [0;40;35m-> bastard, as in "The headline should be 15 bastards wide."
[1;40;37mhertz [1;40;31m-> Hercs, as in "KRAP radio broadcasts at 93.1 megaHercs."
[1;40;37mbyte [0;40;33m-> 9-pin to 24-pin converter on the floor, as in, "So far, my newest
[1;40;37m        [0;40;33mprogram compiles out to about 70 kilo9-pin to 24-pin converters
[1;40;37m        [0;40;33mon the floor."

[1;40;37m Do your duty! Make up bizarre names for units of measurement and post them in
[1;40;33mConference 2! Or in a few tubs of mashed potatoes you'll wake up and find a
[1;40;37mhorse's head next to you in your Bj”rk-sized bed!
