[0;40;37m[0;40;35mWhy Da Warren? [1;40;35m- A history

[1;40;37mWhy is this board called Da Warren? Here's the scoop:
Da: [0;40;37mAren't you sick of "The" tagged onto the name of everybody's BBS? "The This
[1;40;37m    [0;40;37mBBS."  "The That BBS."  "The Other BBS."  We're not The Warren, we're [1;40;37mDa
    [0;40;37mWarren. Got it?
[1;40;37mWarren: [0;40;37mAs you know, rabbits (NOT bunnies) are the silliest creatures in the
        universe, and a warren is the term for a rabbit community (Sheesh... I
        thought everybody knew that.)

[1;40;37mAnd now, a brief history:
[0;40;37m  This board was started on June 23, 1993 out of sheer boredom.  People flocked
to it and it became a cult classic.  Now it's somewhere you can go to do
strange things and not get dirty looks.
