
[1;40;34m  Since you're on this board, we can tell that you'd rather call an anarchic,
feeless board than go to a huge, multi-billion-dollar, commercially funded
concert that purports to have something to do with the original Woodstock.
To congratulate you on your good taste, we're offering you some tips on how to
keep the true concept of Woodstock alive this weekend.

[0;40;35m* While we certainly can't encourage drug use, if you're determined to 
artificially change your physiological state, we certainly can't stop you.
Only take something non-addictive, okay?  If you're cheap, download TOXINS.ZIP
for a handy list of toad species that provide the side effects popularized by
Beavis and Butthead. If you're clean, download ACIDWARP.ZIP and EGALSD.ZIP
for drug simulations, or pick up some surrealistic raytraces and 
psychadelic screen savers.

[1;40;36m* Go New Age.  We've got the files to get you into gemstones (GEMS.ZIP)
and herbology (HEALHERB.ZIP). Read TWP110.ZIP, the ultimate New Age philosiphy
book, and you'll be in the mood. Then delve into the land of the mystical with
OUIJAWIN.ZIP, the Ouija Board for Windows.

[1;40;37m* PARTY! PARTY! PARTY!

[0;40;31m* Try to go through the entire weekend without wanting to kill somebody.  If 
you find yourself becoming angry, see one of the above suggestions. Take out
your frustrations on HATEWAR.ZIP if neccesary.

[0;40;37m* Learn to love and embrace all people, regardless of race, creed, planet of
origin, sexual orientation, sexual disorientation, or whether or not they've
seen "Goodfellas."  This will be much easier for everyone if you refrain from 
paging the sysop at 3 AM.

[1;40;36m* Read a good book.  We've got several avaliable for download. We've also got
some real woofers.  The choice is yours.
