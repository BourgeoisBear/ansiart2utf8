[0;40;32m A lot of people had suspected it, but not until last Saturday were they sure
that 9-year-old Chris Madsen was a hopeless case.
[1;40;36m "We tried to make him stuffy all his life," says his mother, sobbing. "He was
weaned on "Leave It To Beaver... God knows we've tried."
[1;40;34m "He's been doing these silly thinngs all his life," said Chris' father,
trying to remain calm after hearing the news.  "I knew that when he
started calling Da Warren it was bad news.  But I was away on business most of
the time, and I didn't have a lot of time to spend with him.  But this-- this
is worse than I ever dreamed possible!
[0;40;33m What's got Chris' parent's so upset? Well, last Saturday, he was caller 10,000
on Da Warren BBS, ushering in a new age of silliness.
[0;40;31m "There's a poster of Jack Rexx on his wall," says his father, suddenly angry.
"I'm going in there right now and burning it! No, I don't want to continue the
interview! Untie me!"
[1;40;37m Just to encourage this sort of delinquint behaviour, we gave Chris PREFUSER
access until we reach 11,000 calls.  Teach him a lesson by calling often.
