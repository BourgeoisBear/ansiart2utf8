[1;40;35m   Don't you get suspicious of BBSes that claim to have made their file areas
sillier by dumping in millions of files?   Doesn't it make you wonder how stuff
  their file areas were before they made them sillier?  After all, if you make
  something sillier, it had to be  stuffier before.  And is silliness the only
  thing that counts?  What about fun,  coolness, and strangeness?  Well, after
  minutes of painstaking research, our fileologists have presented us with the
         following breakdown of the files avaliable on Da Warren BBS:

[1;40;37m          [1;40;31m60 [0;40;31mare "Silly."              [1;40;31m37 [0;40;31mare "Funny" or "Hilarious."
[1;40;35m          [1;40;31m30 [0;40;31mare "Spiffy."            [1;40;31m119 [0;40;31mare "Fun."
[1;40;35m         [1;40;31m117 [0;40;31mare "Cool."               [1;40;31m18 [0;40;31mare "Handy" or "Useful."
[1;40;35m          [1;40;31m54 [0;40;31mare "Awesome."             [1;40;31m2 [0;40;31mare "Stupid."
[1;40;37m          [1;40;31m53 [0;40;31mare "Neat" or "Neato."     [1;40;31m0 [0;40;31mare "Boring."

[1;40;37m [1;40;35mThis proves once again that Da Warren's file areas have the GUARANTEED HIGHEST
 SILLINESS of any BBS.  And we got that way a few files at a time.  It's not as
   exciting as doing massive dumps  of silly files, but it's our way of doing
 things.  And remember: The only silliness  survey that really counts is yours.
