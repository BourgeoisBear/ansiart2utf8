[1;40;32m  And now, a public service announcement on behalf of Eggs Are People, Too
                         And the Jabbacratic Party

[0;40;32m  Fellow citizens, we can no longer afford to stand idly by and watch as our
brethren the eggs are stripped of their individuality and treated to countless
indignities.  A short list of the many hardships eggs are subjected to follows.

[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mEggs are forced into small cardboard containers and placed into 
  near-freezing temperatures for days on end.
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mSo-called "white" eggs are packaged differently from those that are
  pigmentally gifted.
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37m"White" eggs are marketed more agressively and sell for less than the
  pigmentally gifted, OBVIOUSLY spreading a stigma of non-conformity and thus
  oddity, hence rarity, of the pigmentally gifted eggs.
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mALL eggs are supressed by BLATANT egg-ism, not only in the media 
  (anti-cholesterol ads), and everyday life (nerds being called "eggheads" and
  antisocial children "bad eggs"), but also in our literature (witness the 
  case of one H. Dumpty) and even in our schools (bad grades often being 
  referred to as "goose-eggs").
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mEggs are tortured on an HOURLY basis in dining establishments worldwide.
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mEvery Easter, countless eggs are smothered in dye and left to languish in
  obscure places until found by children.  The eggs are then invariably eaten
  or thrown away.
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mEggs are the unwitting tools of evil doers, such as those who would, on
  Halloween, "egg someone's house."
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mThe asterisk, an ASCII character portraying eggs in a less than positive
  light, is in more common usage now than ever before in our history.
[0;40;37mo [1;40;37mAnd, perhaps most terrifying of all, eggs are forced to live under a
  chicken's butt!
                                                  
  [1;40;34mThus, we, the members of EAPT, have planned a rally in conjunction with
[0;40;34mDa Warren BBS' and the Jabbacratic Party's WECTOLEP on December 17 at
[1;40;34mthe Lampost Pizza on White and Gosford, where we will discuss egg-related 
[0;40;34missues and the rights of the over 20 billion Ovarian-Americans.

[1;40;37mRemember, Jabba and EAPT--Egg-cersize your right, and VOTE!
