[1;40;35m                             "It's Halloween!"

  [0;40;35mTo get you into the spirit of this pagan holiday, we present a Halloween
tribute to Da Warren:
                       (Sung to the tune of "The Monster Mash")
  I was working in my laboratory late one night
  When my eyes beheld an eerie sight
  My monster rose up off the slab, and it gave me quite a chill
  When he went to my computer, started running up my bill!
   
  (He called Da Warren!)
  He called Da Warren BBS!
  (He called Da Warren!)
  And nothing rhymes with BBS!
  (He called Da Warren!)
  Except maybe issocles!
  (He called Da Warren!)

  Soon Igor and the Wolfman had joined him in the fun
  And the mummy was quick to rank Daa Warren number one
  Then the ghostes all arrived, but their disappointmet showed
  When they discovered that Da Warren only had one node.

  (They called Da Warren! etc.)

  Then Dracula, who sells the systems, rose up from his tomb
  And with a puff of smoke appeared in the computer room
  His eyes were laced with malice and his voice was filled with hate
  As he said:
                   "Vatever happened to that 8088?"
  
  (It's now Da Warren! etc.)

  Everything's cool, Drac's part of the plan
  And aall the beasties gather 'round to taalk of Trek and Spam
  You, the living, can call and have a good time
  (As long as Igor isn't mad and holding up the line)

  (Then you can call! etc.)
